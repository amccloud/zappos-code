# Preface
I did a quick image search "Dragon" for a bit of inspiration and to familiarize myself with the variety dragons.
While our delivery could contain Chinese Water Dragons, let's just assume for this RFP they are mythical dragons.
Because dragons are similar to reptiles I also did some research on large reptile habitats and bird habitats because
we wouldn't want our precious dragons flying away.

# Behavior
Dragons are generally large and require space for flying. The larger the habitat the harder to maintain. A large
habitat may also make it difficult for visitors to get a glance of the dragon at any given time. Making the habitat
vertical (like a tall dome) will allow the dragons to fly freely and save on cost on land and maintenance. Giving the
habit circular perimeter will keep the dragons moving and healthy. Corners encourage balking, hiding, etc.

# Containment
Fire is also a hazard to the visitor's and the dragon's own safety. We can't suppress the dragon's fire because that
is a part of the spectacle. Glass is not a great insulator for the visitors because it will melt when exposed to fire
for a prolonged length of time; becoming hot, damaged and dangerous. Aerogel was developed specifically for high
temperatures. We'll likely have to create a composite of Aerogel and glass because Aerogel is slightly opaque. The 
glass will also need to be strong enough to withstand a hit from a dragon.

# Contents
The contents of the habit wouldn't need to be anything special. Fake mountains with caves, greenery, and a small lake.
Resources the dragons need should be strategically placed to encourage exploration and movement. Access doors should be
place around the perimeter for maintenance and feeding. Caves can be locked remotely to act as a holding areas for the
dragons while staff are working in the habitat.

# Training
Training the dragons to cohabit is also something to consider. Cohabiting the dragons could save on space, time, and
money required to build and maintain two identical habitats. According to the movie How to Train Your Dragon this is
completely feasible.
